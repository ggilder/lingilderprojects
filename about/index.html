  <h1>About</h1>

  <p><a href="https://www.careylin.com/">Carey Lin</a> and <a href="http://gabrielgilder.com/">Gabriel Gilder</a> are San Francisco-based visual artists who have collaborated since 2016. Their practice has taken the form of film and video, animation, sound compositions, publications and walking tours for the social practice project <a href="https://stairwells.org/">Stairwell’s</a>. They are interested in exploring different tools and processes with each new project, and the concepts behind their work often include local landscapes and playful or humorous elements.</p>
<p>Lin and Gilder’s work has been presented at Palo Alto Art Center, Roxie Theater, Artists Television Access, Your Mood Gallery, Aggregate Space Gallery, Incline Gallery, New Parkway Theater, Screen Share Video Gallery, Tropical Contemporary, and elsewhere.</p>
